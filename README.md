# Fan-Speed-controller-PCB-Design-using-Altium
Here I have designed a PCB to get the temperature values from DHT11 temperature sensor and to detect the presence of humans using two PIIR sensors. Then this will regulate the speed of the fan according to the temperature taken from the temperature sensor and switch off the fan when there is no human presence.For the processing part I used Atmega328Pu Ic and use relays and to swiching purpose.
I used Altium Designer in order to design the PCB.
I have attached the PCB schematic pdf of the PCB and all the design files.
